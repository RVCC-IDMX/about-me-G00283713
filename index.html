<h2>Why Japanese Swords</h2>

<div>

    <p>The Muromachi Period was a very volatile time in history for Japan. Everyone was at war with each other. This made a high demand for blades. This Blade embodies part of what the Samurai were like during the time it was made. The blade is a bit tired, showing its age. Likely made in the 13 to 1400s this Tachi is like most other Muromachi blades, O Suriage. Most of if not the whole original Nakago or tang is gone. You can tell it was shortened by the way the Nakago is physically as well as having multiple holes. The sword at one point was much much longer, and had greater curve or sori. In war time condition, this ancient Koto blade was found in WW2 Shin Gunto Mounts in relatively good condition. Requires a polish, new habaki, shirasaya, and NBTHK papers. </p>

    <p>The sword pictured in its mounts is a WW2 period made Gendaito meaning traditionally made, by Tsutsui Kiyokane. His family had been making swords for the Okazaki Clan. He was a high rated smith during WW2 and his name is becoming more sought after. The Koshirae meaning the mounts are incredibly preserved and are covered in Ox leather. This leather is in remarkable condition and the leather handle cover is something that gets lost very quickly during that time. This sword was ordered by a wealthy person, who knew swords had different qualities, and that the mounts were essential to keeping the blade in good condition. Finding examples like this with good blades and good mounts are quite hard to do. The blade is signed and dated making it part of a very small percentage of swords made during WW2. I would say 80 to 90 percent of all blades made during WW2 were non traditional Seki Showato. Just being a Gendaito already puts you at a very small amount of blades in comparison to them all. There is also the treat of finding old heirloom blades in Gunto mounts. They are still out there all over the states. </p>
    
    <p>The third picture shows although not the best quality photo a Wakizashi made by Kouzuke No Kami Yoshikuni in Tosa during Kanbun Shinto around 1660s. The wakizashi is slightly shortened meaning suriage. Likely to fit some nice mounts. The blade is a Wakizashi done in his masters style Yamato Yoshimichi. The grain structure is superb, no flaws and the polisher was a true master. First Class Polish. Focused is the grain structure and the temper line of the sword which can only be seen at a certain angle and light. The itame hada or grain structure is well executed and the hamon is a wonder bright suguha with sunagashi and various other traits. Very nice blade. This Yoshikuni made blades that were sharp or known as Wazamono. </p>
    
    <p>Out of my love for Japanese swords and watching Forged In Fire for years, I decided to start trying to make my own things. I started with tiny pocket knives and stuff. Gradually into bigger things. Some forged some cut from a nice piece of steel. My aim with this sword was to make it short, very curved with a almost hitatsura like hamon but instead its a choji and tobiyaki hamon. The blade must be tempered in the right season under the proper conditions. The clay acts as a barrier to keep the steel from cooling very fast. The edge is left without it so it becomes hard. The blade when quenchd will undergo stress as the quenching agent used for Japanese swords is water and not oil. Water produces Nie and Nioi. Oil doesn't. The blade during wuench will likely mecome ven more curved and possible take on a bend. Or worst of all a hagire also known as a stress crack in the edge rendering the blade useless. It will be my first time quenching something of this size.</p>

    <p>I love this hobby of sword collecting because there are in fact intended not only to be weapons but art. Each school had their own techniques and skills. The oldest being the most closely guarded and unknown to this day for sure. The oldest of swords still in existence have seen many things. To put into perspectives there were still samurai while this country was having its Revolution. Some swords have been around so long. My focus is WW2 mounted swords because you never know what you will find in them. Mostly showato but on occasions you will find a gendaito or a old blade. There have been blades from the 12 and 1300s discovered here in USA in gunto mounts. These kinds of relics are still out there and I want to find them! This hobby and knowledge is very focuses to small groups of people. I want to do my best to spread the love of swords as well as the knowledge so that the hobby will grow. Japanese Nihonto are very misunderstood to this day and are greatly undervalued. In my view everyone should have at least one Nihonto in their collection of things. </p>
